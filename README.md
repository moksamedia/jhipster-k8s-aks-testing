## Instructions

You will need to put the client secret I sent you in `k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml` where it says `<CLIENT_SECRET>`.

Otherwise this is the deployment in the cluster you set up for me.

I have been trying to apply the `store-k8s` deployment with (from the `k8s` directory):
```bash
kubectl apply -f store-k8s/
```
